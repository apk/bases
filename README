This is an exercise of doing strange and new methods of encoding some binary as ascii.

carray - produce a C array body (just the ... of 'char name [] = { ... };}'

e64 - encode in base64

hex2bin - take hex characters and convert to byte stream

bin2hex - take byte stream and output as (pure) hex dump

inv94 - replace printable ascii chars by the characater the same distance
 from the other end of the printable range, so ! becomes ~ and vice versa.

rot13 - you know that
